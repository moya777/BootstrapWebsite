        <img src="ahkterabtme.jpg" alt="Emama Akhter" class = "float-right" width="500px" >
        <p>  Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Emama Akhter. I am a Computer Science and Information Technology (CS/IT) teacher at the Brooklyn STEAM Center. Along with my full time job, I am also a part time traveling enthusiast.
          <br><br>
          My traveling journey began in 2017 when I was a full time worker in the IT industry. I spontaneously booked a Eurotrip and mapped the entire itinerary myself with very limited research, which in itself was exhilarating to do, along with planning my outfits of course. Ten days, five cities with a $2000 budget, and I had the time of my life!
          <br><br>
          It was my first time out of the US visiting places that were not my home country, Bangladesh and it was a rush I've never felt prior! Experiencing different cultures, tasting food from different regions, seeing historic architecture and various landscapes.. It was exhilarating to say the least and it opened Pandora's box, thus the start of my travel journey. 
          <br><br>
          Join me here on Travel Akht, as I share my experiences from my ever expanding list of countries all over the world. Itineraries, places to see, must try cuisines, fashion tips, all included!
